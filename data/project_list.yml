    pain: With kids becoming digitally native at a much younger age learning how to navigate and interact with social media is increasingly more important. Bullying fake news and scams have massively negative consequences to kids who struggle to deal with a 24/7 form of constant feedback and interaction with society.
    solution: This app is a social media that will only be accessible to students of the same school. By creating a social media intranet students will interact with classmates and peers in a safe space and be introduced on a much smaller scale to how social media work and the issues which are associated with it. Their blogs comments and profiles are only accessible to mutal friends. They\ll also have the opportunity for direct messaging and communicating with friends privately.

    pain: As a group project one of the teammates explained the issues that can occur by poor communication or issues in organizing tasks. Lead nurses have to spend extra time ensuring nurse workloads correspond to abilities while serving patients\ needs. They also need to follow up on nurses\ progress and help or rearrange as necessary. Member nurses spend a lot of time figuring out their schedules with patients and collating information from several different sources. At the same time they need to be aware of their own progress of any updates and communicate with other staff.
    solution: By assessing the problems that nursing staff go through we wanted to automate patient assignments based on important criteria. After patients were assigned we wanted to make sure that the Lead nurse could easily track their team\s progress. The Member nurses wanted a quick overview of their day including the number of tasks their patients\ severity levels and a list of their patients. They wanted extra information provided to them for each patient and a way to organize all of their tasks and optimize their schedules. By using a drag and drop system it easily allowed customization of persistent schedules. A notification system allowed for updates to be received along with an assistance button which directly communicates to their lead nurse.

    pain: During COVID-19 schools were forced to move away from traditional models and move quickly into providing a digital means for their product. This was difficult as schools largely rely on teaching to take place on campuses with very little online interaction. As a private international school they had to provide an online platform for content delivery to maintain their business.
    solution: To solve the issues associated with lockdowns and social distancing the school decided to create a website for content delivery and managing their online streaming and classes. Since then it has morphed into a much bigger project also being used to attract prospective customers and organise information events and providing insights into their programme.
